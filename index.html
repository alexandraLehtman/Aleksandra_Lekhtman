            <h3>Facts about me that you won't see on a resume</h3>
        
            <p>My name is Alexandra, but I prefer Sasha;) I am open and friendly, I love animals and have a cat and a dog.  I go to the gym and love an active lifestyle.  I also like to help others, until recently I was a volunteer in the organization "Big Brother" where they accompany lone soldiers who serve in the Israeli army and do not have a family in Israel (once I myself was like that).  I also volunteered for the Israeli police.  In my work I am very responsible, hardworking and do not like to be late.
